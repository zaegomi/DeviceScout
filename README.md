### Installing Nmap

**Windows:**
1. Download from: https://nmap.org/download.html#windows
2. Run the installer and ensure "Add Nmap to PATH" is checked
3. Restart your terminal after installation

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install nmap
```

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nmap
```

**Verify Installation:**
```bash

## üîí Security Considerations

- **Local Network Only** - DeviceScout scans your local network subnet
- **No External Data Transmission** - All scanning and analysis performed locally
- **Responsible Testing** - Credential testing limited to prevent account lockouts
- **Admin Privileges** - Enhanced scanning features may require elevated permissions
- **Firewall Configuration** - Ensure your firewall allows local network communication
- **SSL/TLS Analysis** - Certificate checking does not store or transmit sensitive data

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

**"Nmap not found" errors:**
- Verify Nmap installation: `nmap --version`
- Ensure Nmap is in your system PATH
- Restart terminal after installation (especially on Windows)

**Enhanced scan takes longer:**
- Normal enhanced scan time: 60-120 seconds for comprehensive analysis
- SSL and credential testing add processing time
- Large networks may take several minutes for complete assessment

**SSL connection errors:**
- Some devices may reject SSL connections from scanning tools
- Self-signed certificates will generate warnings but still be analyzed
- Network firewalls may block SSL analysis attempts

**Permission errors:**
- Enhanced security features may require administrator/root privileges
- Run terminal as administrator (Windows) or use `sudo` (Mac/Linux)
- Some credential testing requires elevated network access

### Frontend Issues

**Cannot connect to backend:**
- Verify backend is running on `http://localhost:3001`
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Ensure both frontend and backend are running

**Export features not working:**
- Ensure jsPDF library is loaded (check browser console)
- Verify scan data exists before attempting export
- Check browser's download/popup blocking settings

### Scanning Issues

**Enhanced scan timeout:**
- Increase timeout values in scanner configuration
- Skip problematic devices and continue with scan
- Check network connectivity and device responsiveness

**No SSL information:**
- Ensure target devices have HTTPS services running
- Verify devices are not blocking SSL connections
- Check that certificates are properly configured on target devices

**Credential testing fails:**
- Verify network connectivity to target services
- Ensure services accept the tested authentication methods
- Check for rate limiting or intrusion detection systems

## üìà Performance Notes

- **Enhanced Scan Speed:** 60-120 seconds for comprehensive security analysis
- **Resource Usage:** Higher CPU/memory usage during SSL and credential testing
- **Network Impact:** More thorough scanning generates additional network traffic
- **Concurrent Scans:** Only one enhanced scan should run at a time
- **Data Persistence:** Scan results automatically saved to browser storage

## üìä Export & Reporting Features
